 @discussion The <code>CBPeripheralManager</code> class is an abstraction of the Peripheral and Broadcaster GAP roles, and the GATT Server
 *              role. Its primary function is to allow you to manage published services within the GATT database, and to advertise these services
 *              to other devices.
 *              Each application has sandboxed access to the shared GATT database. You can add services to the database by calling {@link addService:};
 *              they can be removed via {@link removeService:} and {@link removeAllServices}, as appropriate. While a service is in the database,
 *              it is visible to and can be accessed by any connected GATT Client. However, applications that have not specified the "bluetooth-peripheral"
 *              background mode will have the contents of their service(s) "disabled" when in the background. Any remote device trying to access
 *              characteristic values or descriptors during this time will receive an error response.
 *              Once you've published services that you want to share, you can ask to advertise their availability and allow other devices to connect
 *              to you by calling {@link startAdvertising:}. Like the GATT database, advertisement is managed at the system level and shared by all
 *              applications. This means that even if you aren't advertising at the moment, someone else might be!

 *				<code>CBAttributePermissionsReadable</code>. If a characteristic value needs to be writeable, or may change during the lifetime of the
